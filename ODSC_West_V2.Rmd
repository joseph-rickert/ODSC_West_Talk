### Data Exploration with R
Most data exploration involves looking short subsets of data, generating statistical summaries, generating quick visualizations and running simple models. In R, a good bit of this can be conducted interactively with built-in, one line functions.

The plots here are just a couple of exameples of the quick, very basic visualizations that a statistian or data scientist will make for herself with R basic graphics system. There are three plotting systems in R including the very popular ggplot2 graphics system. Base graphics plots are mostly very basic, however, with a little more work it is not difficult to make more sophisticated, pleasing plots.

```{r}
x <- rgamma(1000,1,.5) # Simulate 100 randow draws from a standard normal distribution
head(x)
summary(x)      # Generate a statistical summary of the numbers
hist(x)         # Plot a histogram of the distribution
boxplot(x)      # Look at a boxplot
y <- x + rnorm(1000,2,10)
plot(x,y)
```

Next, we build a simple regression model and examine the model object.
```{r}
model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(model)
plot(model)
str(model)
```
### R - A Functional, Object Based Language
Everything that exists in R is an object

R promotes encapsulation - separate but related data are packaged together.

R classes are polymorphic - generic gunctions like plot and summary may have different methods for different objects or data structures

Some basic interplary of functions and objects add a regression line to the scatter plot above.
```{r}
plot(x,y)
abline(model, col = "red")
```
It is not much more difficult to draw more sophisticated looing simple plots using the either the additional plotting systems based on the lattice or ggplot2 graphic systems.
yuu
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(x,y)
ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

### Functions
"A function is a group of instructions that takes inputs, uses them to compute other values, and returns the result" - Norm Matloff The Art of R Programming

Let's write our own mean function  
```{r}
pemax <- c(95,85,100,85,95,80,65,110,70,95,110,90,100,80,134) #some data
jmean <- function(x){
	m <- sum(x)/length(x)	
	return(m)
}
jmean(pemax)

```
Try again and improve the formatting
```{r}
jmean2 <- function(x){
	m <- round(sum(x)/length(x),2)
	return(m)
}

jmean2(pemax)
```
Why not give the user more control of the rounding process?   
The magic 3 dots ... enable arguments to be passed to sub functions  

```{r}
jmean3 <- function(x,...){
	m <- round(sum(x)/length(x),...)
	return(m)
}
#?round						# look to see what parameters round is expecting

jmean3(pemax,3)
jmean3(pemax)				# the default value for round is 0
jmean3(pemax,1)
```  
## Functions calling Functions  
How about giving the user a choice about which rounding function to use?  
Look at the difference between round() and signif().
```{r}
pi
round(pi,4)
signif(pi,4)
```
This is the way to have one function call an other function
```{r}
jmean4 <- function(x,FUN,...){
	m <- FUN(sum(x)/length(x),...)
	return(m)
}
jmean4(pemax,round,4)
jmean4(pemax,signif,4)
```
### More Visualizations

In some cases, specialized packages implement plots that work with specific kinds of data. Here is a specialized financial plot rendered in just a few lines of code.
```{r}
library(quantmod)

# get S&P 500 data from FRED (St. Louis Fed)
sp500 <- na.omit( 
  getSymbols(
    "SP500",
    src = "FRED",
    from = "1949-12-31",
    auto.assign = FALSE
  )
)

sp500.monthly <- sp500[endpoints(sp500, on ="months")]
chartSeries(
  sp500.monthly,
  theme = chartTheme("white"),
  TA = c(addBBands(),addTA(RSI(sp500.monthly)))
)

```

### More sophisticated Graphics.
Here we use data on the overflow of the Nile river to illustrate the the kinds of visualizations that can be made with ggplot2 and Javascript.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)            # for plotting functions
# library(car)                # for the recode function, rc
library(reshape2)           # for melt function to build long form data frame
library(pracma)             # for Nile river data
data(nile)
head(nile)
# Many data frames arenaturally in “wide” form. To plot this data with ggplot2 te data must be transformed into “long” form.
nile_dat <- melt(nile,idvar="Year",measure.vars=month.abb,variable.name="Month",value.name="Obs")
nile_dat_long <- nile_dat[with(nile_dat,order(Year,Month)),]         # sort

# Make a date variable
nile_dat_long$Date <- paste(with(nile_dat_long,Date<- paste(Month,"-","15","-",as.character(Year),sep="")))
nile_dat_long$Date <- as.Date(nile_dat_long$Date,format="%b-%d-%Y")

head(nile_dat_long)

# Plot the time series
p <- ggplot(nile_dat_long[100:300,],aes(x=Date,y=Obs))
p + geom_line() + geom_point(shape=1,col="red") + 
  ylab("Flow in cubic meters / second") + 
  ggtitle("Monthly Flow of Nile River at Dongola Station")

# Boxplots of monthly flows
b <- ggplot(nile_dat_long,aes(factor(Month),Obs))
b + geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Flow in cubic meters / second") + 
  ggtitle("Variation of Flow at Dongola Station by Month")
```  
### Create an interactive graph with a Javascript library
```{r}
library(xts)
library(dygraphs)
# Make into a time series object
nile_ts <- xts(nile_dat_long$Obs,
               order.by=nile_dat_long$Date,
               frequency=12,start=c(1871,1))

# Plot wit htmlwidget dygraph
dygraph(nile_ts,ylab="cubic m / s", 
        main="Nile Monthly Flow Data") %>%
  dySeries("V1",label="Flow") %>%
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1871-01-01","1984-12-01"))
```
